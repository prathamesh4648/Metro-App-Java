# Metro-App-Java
The Backend Implementation of a Delhi Metro App which in detail provides you with the shortest and cheapest routes from source station to the Destination station. 

The Graph_M.java file contains the implementation of different classes, functions and methods required for the implementation of metro app. It has functions to create map,add stations ,check stations ,display map, Check route from source to destination,return cheapest route ,return shortest route.

The Heap.java file contains the implementation of the heap required to retrieve the shortest distance station from the data structure heap which returns lowest and highest values based on its implementation. For the project purpose I have implementated the min heap so as to retrieve the stations with minimum distance first.
